# Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)

## Introduction

Welcome, adventurer! Are you ready for a change?

CYOA is an app for adventurous people who are ready to move to a different city but want a little help from the Magic 8 Ball in deciding.
Despite the magic 8 ball outcome, you must decide whether to like/dislike the city before you see another random choice (think Tinder for cities!). Liked cities are saved to favorites, if it's a "Nope", you wonâ€™t see it again.

This application was built mobile-first and the best experience will be on mobile. However, it is fully responsive across multiple breakpoints.

## Overview of the app

When you first visit CYOA you see a random city, a summary, and some quality of life metrics (to help you decide).

Then you ask the Magic 8 ball -- should I move there?

Regardless of what the Magic 8 Ball says, you decide whether you like the city or not! Get to clicking!

From the favorites page, you can view details again (perhaps remind yourself what you liked about the city in the first place). Don't like it anymore ? Break up with it. We don't care.

## Evolution of the Project/Reflections

## Future Features

In future, I hope to add localStorage to the application so that favorites persist upon refresh and you truly will never see disliked cities again. When I add localStorage, I will also add a button on the favorites page that will allow users to clear their local data and get a fresh start. If users have cycled through all 200-something cities in the API, a message will appear letting them know that there aren't any more options and directing them to the favorites page so they can get that fresh start on their search.

I would also like to refactor my css to use Styled Components and add lazy loading to improve the UI/UX.

Since the app is best experienced on mobile, I would also like to turn it into a PWA and add swipe left/right functionality to the main page.
